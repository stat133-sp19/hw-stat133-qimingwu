## Binomial Distribution Package

In this project, I created an R package. This package provides basic functions to simulate the binomial distribution.
The package allows users to calculate probabilities, plot distributions and get summary statistics for the binomial distribution.

### Package Structure

This is a basic R package with standard components.  
`R/` contains source code for various functions of the package.  
`tests/` contains some unit tests to check various functionalities of the package.  
`man/` contains documentations to help users understand the _main_ functions.  
`vignettes/` contains an introductory document that helps users get started with the package.  
`DISCRIPTION` and `NAMESPACE` contain the basic information about the package and its functionalities.  
`devtools-flow` contains the basic devtool commands to test, build and install the package.

### Getting Started

Please read the introduction in the `vignettes/` directory to learn the basic workflow and usage.
