##GSW Shot Charts

This is a data analysis project using the R programming language.  
In this individual project, I analyzed some shots data for five NBA players in Golden State Warriors in 2016 season.  
After carefully importing, cleaning and preparing the data, I created some effective summary statistics and "shot charts" to visualize the position of shots represented by horizontal and vertical coordinates in the court.  
I also created tables to rank the five players by their success rate of shots.  
At the end of the project, I wrote a report to discuss my work and findings in this data analysis project, incorporating texts, images, codes, etc. This report offers key insights obtained from the shots data.

####File Structures
Files for this project are organized in 5 subdirectories.  
code/ directory includes all code for importing, cleaning, preparing data for visualization.  
data/ directory includes raw data in five .csv files, one for each player, along with the cleaned and combined data used in the visualization phase of the project. The directory also includes a data dictionary which outlines the basic information of the data: column names, data types and short descriptions.  
images/ directory includes all charts created in the visualization (i.e. shot charts). Each player has one shot chart, and another chart that combines individual charts into one using the facetting tool in R.  
output/ directory includes summary statistics for each player, and one for the combined data set.  
report/ directory includes the final report that summarizes all findings gained from the data analysis.
