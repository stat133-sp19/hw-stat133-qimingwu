## Saving Returns

In this project, I created a Shiny App using the R programming language.
The Shiny App helps users calculate their saving returns by customizing the saving mode, length, interest rate, initial amount, etc. Then the App creates a graph to visualize the growing value of investment in each year. The app also displays a table to compare the total value of investment of three modes using the user inputs.

#### File Structure
This project only includes one file - app.R - which includes both the UI and the server part of the Shiny App.
